## üéØ Overview

Privacy Evidence Manager is a revolutionary blockchain-based judicial evidence management system that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure absolute confidentiality of sensitive legal evidence while maintaining transparency and auditability on-chain.

The system enables secure submission, review, and management of confidential legal evidence with cryptographic guarantees that sensitive information remains encrypted throughout its entire lifecycle - even during computational operations.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without requiring decryption. In the context of judicial evidence management, this means:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Evidence remains encrypted from submission through review to final judgment
- **Confidential Computation**: Evidence can be verified, analyzed, and processed while remaining encrypted
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Authorized parties can validate evidence authenticity without exposing sensitive content
- **Granular Access Control**: Different encryption keys enable role-based access to evidence categories

### Privacy-Preserving Judicial Workflow

The system implements a complete judicial evidence lifecycle with cryptographic privacy guarantees:

1. **Confidential Case Creation**: Judges create cases with encrypted metadata and access controls
2. **Secure Evidence Submission**: Evidence submitters upload encrypted evidence with FHE protection
3. **Private Review Process**: Authorized reviewers can assess evidence integrity without decryption
4. **Encrypted Verdict Recording**: Final judgments are recorded with privacy-preserving cryptographic proofs
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency of actions while maintaining content confidentiality

### Role-Based Access Architecture

Three distinct roles ensure separation of concerns and security:

- **Judges**: Create cases, authorize reviewers, grant access permissions, and close cases
- **Reviewers**: Examine submitted evidence and update status (approve/reject)
- **Evidence Submitters**: Upload encrypted evidence to assigned cases

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Smart Contract Infrastructure

The system is powered by the `PrivacyEvidenceManager` smart contract deployed on Ethereum-compatible networks with FHE support:

**Contract Address**: `0x2BB2Eed0a66d74D92897aFAADa41a988E50C1830` (Sepolia Testnet)

**Key Features**:
- FHE-encrypted evidence storage
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-level security classifications (Public, Restricted, Confidential, Top Secret)
- Immutable audit trail
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Evidence Classification System

Evidence is categorized by type and security level:

**Evidence Types**:
- üìÑ **Document**: Written evidence, contracts, agreements
- üì∏ **Photo**: Visual evidence, crime scene photos
- üé• **Video**: Surveillance footage, recordings
- üîä **Audio**: Voice recordings, wiretaps
- üìä **Digital**: Computer forensics, digital artifacts
- üß¨ **Forensic**: DNA, fingerprints, lab results
- üëÅÔ∏è **Witness**: Testimony transcripts, depositions
- üìã **Other**: Miscellaneous evidence

**Security Levels**:
1. **Public** (Level 0): Non-sensitive information
2. **Restricted** (Level 1): Limited distribution
3. **Confidential** (Level 2): Authorized personnel only
4. **Top Secret** (Level 3): Highest security clearance required
